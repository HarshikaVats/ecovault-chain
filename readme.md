## Project Summary <a name="project-summary"></a>

### The Issue We Are Hoping to Solve <a name="the-issue-we-are-hoping-to-solve"></a>

<p align="justify">As we move further into the era of web3, one of the most significant challenges is the lack of practical, user-friendly applications that offer real value to everyday users and businesses. Most web3 projects today are focused on NFTs, staking, or minting, which appeal to a niche market but don't address the broader needs of the global consumer base. This has resulted in a large portion of users, approximately 99%, remaining within the web2 ecosystem due to comfort, familiarity, and the absence of meaningful incentives to transition to web3.</p>

<p align="justify">Moreover, there is an increasing global emphasis on sustainability. E-commerce, as a rapidly expanding sector, faces mounting pressure to reduce its environmental impact, particularly when it comes to delivery logistics. The traditional delivery model contributes to excessive carbon emissions due to inefficient routes and redundant delivery trips. With consumers and companies alike becoming more environmentally conscious, the need for an innovative solution that promotes greener delivery options has never been more urgent.</p>

<p align="justify">Thus, we identified two major challenges: First, making web3 technology more accessible and practical for everyday users and businesses. Second, addressing the environmental impact of the e-commerce industry, particularly regarding last-mile delivery logistics.</p>

<br>

### How Our Technology Solution Can Help <a name="how-our-technology-solution-can-help"></a>

<p align="justify">To address these challenges, we created <b>EcoVault Chain</b>, a forward-thinking platform that combines the strengths of web3 technology with sustainable delivery practices.

They are also provided with eco-conscious delivery options, such as picking up their orders from local vaults. These vaults reduce the environmental impact of deliveries by encouraging users to collect their packages when it’s convenient for them, rather than relying on multiple delivery attempts.</li></ul></p>

<p align="justify"> <ul> <li><b>Sellers</b>: Sellers have the ability to onboard themselves onto the platform and list their products. With blockchain providing an added layer of security, sellers can ensure transparency in every transaction. The platform also offers the flexibility to manage orders, view analytics, and reach a larger, eco-conscious audience by offering sustainable delivery solutions.</li></ul></p>

<p align="justify"> <ul> <li><b>Web3 & Decentralization</b>: EcoVault Chain uses a browser extension, WhatsApp chatbot, and physical vaults to provide users with multiple touchpoints. This ensures that users can interact with the platform in a way that’s most convenient for them, whether they are familiar with web3 or prefer a more traditional web2 experience. The platform's decentralized nature, powered by blockchain, ensures that both buyers and sellers benefit from a secure and transparent system.</li></ul></p>

<p align="justify"> <ul> <li><b>Sustainability & Green Logistics</b>: One of the defining features of EcoVault Chain is its focus on sustainability. By encouraging buyers to pick up packages from local vaults, the platform drastically reduces the number of delivery trips and lowers the carbon footprint associated with traditional e-commerce. The entire process is designed to make sustainability an integral part of the shopping experience without compromising convenience.</li></ul></p>

<p align="justify">Additionally, EcoVault Chain is built using IBM's <b>RedHat OpenShift Container Platform</b> to ensure scalability, security, and performance. This containerized environment allows for smooth operation and deployment, enabling the platform to scale easily as the user base grows.</p>

<p align="justify">The combination of cutting-edge web3 technology, IBM’s powerful WatsonX services, and a commitment to sustainability makes EcoVault Chain a trailblazer in the world of e-commerce. By focusing on real-world problems like last-mile delivery inefficiencies and the environmental impact of logistics, EcoVault Chain offers a solution that is both practical and forward-thinking, helping to usher in a new era of eco-friendly online shopping.</p>

### IBM watsonx product(s) used <a name="ibm-ai-services-used"></a>

**Featured watsonx products**

- [watsonx ai, data, & governance](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) -
  <p align="justify">It is being used in the <b>Text to SQL AI Model</b> for the buyers in the extension. I leveraged IBM WatsonX.ai, IBM’s cutting-edge AI platform, to build and deploy my Test-to-SQL model—a natural language processing model that translates user queries into SQL commands. The model enhances the user experience by allowing users to input text-based queries and retrieve structured data efficiently. Here's the step-by-step process that was followed using WatsonX to make the model live:</p>
  <img width="256px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e93fa881-8536-4ea7-9e8b-2196f46f13de">
  <p align="justify">
    <b>1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing with WatsonX Data</b>: Using IBM WatsonX.data, we ingested a large dataset containing human-readable test queries and their corresponding SQL commands. The platform’s ability to handle unstructured data, including various text formats and SQL queries, made the ingestion process seamless. Through WatsonX’s data connectors, we were able to connect various data sources such as relational databases (MySQL) and existing datasets to build a comprehensive training corpus.

      Data Sources: Sample queries and corresponding SQL statements from various domains (e.g., e-commerce, finance).
      Preprocessing: With the help of WatsonX, we cleaned and normalized the text data using built-in text extraction and data cleansing tools, ensuring uniformity in query formats and SQL outputs.

  <b>2. Model Training Using WatsonX.ai</b>: The core of the project revolved around training the Test-to-SQL model using IBM WatsonX.ai. WatsonX provided a flexible and scalable environment to build the machine learning pipeline.

       Model Architecture: We used a Transformer-based architecture for this task, leveraging WatsonX’s Granite model series (Granite-13B-chat) for encoding the natural language queries.

       Transfer Learning: The WatsonX models, trained on large-scale data, offered an excellent base. Using transfer learning, we fine-tuned the pre-existing models using the Test-to-SQL dataset prepared earlier.

       Hyperparameter Optimization: WatsonX’s automated machine learning (AutoML) tools helped optimize hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and the number of epochs, ensuring efficient training and minimizing overfitting.

  <b>3. Real-time Inference via WatsonX.ai APIs</b>: After successfully training the model, I deployed it using WatsonX.ai's APIs for real-time inference. The WatsonX platform provided the necessary tools to deploy the model as a REST API.

       Endpoint Management: The model was exposed through a WatsonX.ai REST endpoint that allowed the translation of natural language queries to SQL commands in real-time.

       API Integration: The API was integrated into the front-end application that users interact with, where they input text queries, and the API returns SQL statements for further execution.


  <b>4. Model Monitoring and Governance with WatsonX Governance</b>:To ensure the continued performance of the Test-to-SQL model and maintain model governance, I employed WatsonX.governance.

       Audit and Monitoring: The model’s performance, including accuracy, response time, and error rates, was continuously monitored using WatsonX’s model management tools. Regular audits ensured the model remained within the set accuracy thresholds.
       Security: WatsonX.governance also helped to implement role-based access controls (RBAC), ensuring that only authorized users could access the sensitive data queried via the model.

  <b>5. Collaboration and Team Management</b>: Throughout the development lifecycle, WatsonX provided a collaborative platform for multiple stakeholders:

       Multi-user environment: Developers and data scientists could simultaneously work on different aspects of the model, such as tweaking the dataset, improving the model, or analyzing the results.
       Versioning and Experiment Tracking: Using WatsonX’s built-in tools for experiment tracking and version control, I could track different versions of the model to ensure consistent improvements and rollback options when needed.

  <b>6. Integrating with Existing Databases</b>: The final step was integrating the Test-to-SQL model with existing relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL to allow live querying. WatsonX’s APIs were instrumental in establishing secure connections to external databases, ensuring that real-time SQL queries could be executed without latency.

       Database Queries: SQL commands generated by the model were dynamically executed on the linked databases to return results, making the entire setup real-time and responsive.

<br>

> <b>Conclusion:</b>
> Using IBM WatsonX, we were able to build, fine-tune, and deploy the Test-to-SQL model seamlessly. WatsonX's advanced AI models, data management tools, and governance features played a pivotal role in ensuring that the model is not only accurate but also scalable and secure for real-world use. This deployment enhances user interaction with databases through natural language queries, simplifying complex SQL command generation.</p>
