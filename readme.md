## Project Summary <a name="project-summary"></a>

### The Issue We Are Hoping to Solve <a name="the-issue-we-are-hoping-to-solve"></a>

<p align="justify">As we move into the Web3 era, the promises of decentralization, security, and transparency have created a lot of excitement. Web3 advantages such as:

<ul>
  <li><b>Security:</b> Transactions are secure and immutable</li>
  <li><b>Transperancy:</b> Blockchain technology ensures transparency in operations</li>
  <li><b>Decentralization:</b> No central authority controlling the data or processes.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p align="justify">Despite these immense advantages, Web3 applications today predominantly focus on minting cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other speculative uses. These may appeal to a niche audience, but there’s a severe lack of practical, real-world applications that cater to the everyday needs of global consumers. The majority of users, about 99%, remain in the Web2 ecosystem, with no meaningful incentive to transition into Web3.</p>

<p align="justify">One significant global activity that touches everyone’s lives, regardless of their geography, is trade and e-commerce. With the increasing digitization of businesses, buying and selling are at an all-time peak. However, despite this boom, there’s no robust e-commerce solution integrated with Web3 technology that caters to both buyers and sellers.</p>

<p align="justify">Further, another overlooked issue is the <b>carbon emissions</b> generated by traditional delivery systems. Packages often travel the same route that buyers will be commuting on later, leading to redundant travel and unnecessary carbon emissions. The environmental impact of these inefficient systems is substantial and needs to be addressed with innovative solutions.</p>

<br>

### How Our Technology Solution Can Help <a name="how-our-technology-solution-can-help"></a>

<p align="justify">Ecovault Chain was conceptualized as a solution that leverages the power of Web3 while addressing the everyday e-commerce needs of buyers and sellers. It’s not just another Web3 project for NFTs or cryptocurrency, but one that focuses on providing meaningful, real-world value. Here’s how:

<ul>
  <li><b>Empowering Small Sellers:</b> The project allows small sellers to break out of their local markets and reach international buyers. By integrating their products on a decentralized platform, sellers can expand their reach exponentially, turning local shops into global brands.</li>
  <li><b>Reducing Carbon Emissions:</b> The project also tackles the environmental impact of traditional e-commerce delivery systems. Our research showed that nearly 99% of the time, packages and buyers commute similar routes. Delivering packages directly to buyers results in unnecessary commute, adding to carbon emissions.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<br>

### Our Idea <a name="our-idea"></a>

<p align="justify">To address the issues mentioned, Ecovault Chain introduces a dual solution that combines Web3 technology with a hardware component to create a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and secure delivery system:
<ul>
  <li><b>Empowering Sellers & Buyers:</b> We provide small, local sellers with the opportunity to transcend their local presence by tapping into the global market through blockchain technology. The platform allows sellers to list their products on a decentralized marketplace and securely interact with buyers through verified, transparent transactions. By using blockchain, the sellers gain trust, and buyers are assured of a secure purchase process. Sellers can now turn their local shops into global brands, enhancing both visibility and revenue opportunities. Buyers, on the other hand, are granted access to a wide variety of products, with the added security of blockchain’s immutable transaction records.</li>

  <li><b>Reducing Carbon Emissions via Smart Ecovaults:</b> Traditional e-commerce delivery methods often involve inefficient delivery routes, contributing to carbon emissions. Our solution to this is the introduction of Ecovaults, which are strategically placed, RFID-accessible hardware vaults. These vaults serve as delivery points for buyers to collect their packages, significantly reducing redundant delivery trips and cutting down emissions. By enabling buyers to pick up their packages when it’s most convenient for them, we further decrease the environmental impact of last-mile deliveries.

This project goes beyond simple order and delivery — it redefines how e-commerce can operate by integrating green logistics with a focus on sustainability. As trade and shopping will continue indefinitely, our solution is designed to be a future-proof method of streamlining logistics while benefiting both sellers and buyers, ultimately contributing to a greener planet.</li>

  <li><b>Integration with Web3:</b> Instead of sticking to traditional Web2-based applications, we leverage the security and transparency of Web3 technology. By using blockchain, all transactions and deliveries are securely tracked, providing a robust layer of trust between buyers and sellers. This decentralization ensures that data integrity is maintained while reducing the risk of fraud or tampering. Through Web3, we offer a multi-point access experience via a browser extension, WhatsApp chatbot, and the physical Ecovaults, providing users with flexible, seamless touchpoints regardless of their comfort level with technology.</li>

  <li><b>Sustainability & Scalability:</b> Built using IBM’s RedHat OpenShift Container Platform, our infrastructure scales effortlessly as the user base grows. OpenShift provides us with the power to maintain high performance, ensuring that our platform remains operational even as demand increases. By integrating cutting-edge WatsonX services for AI-based assistance, IBM Cloud technologies for deployment, and a commitment to sustainability, we believe Ecovault Chain will revolutionize e-commerce logistics and reshape the future of retail, making it more secure, transparent, and eco-friendly.</li>
</ul>

## Technology implementation <a name="technology-implementation"></a>
This project is a perfect culmination of software and hardware, and provide a lot of things to interact with. So, let's start diving into the details.

### IBM watsonx product(s) used <a name="ibm-ai-services-used"></a>

**Featured watsonx products**

- [watsonx ai, data, & governance](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) -
  <p align="justify">It is being used in the <b>Text to SQL AI Model</b> for the buyers in the extension. We leveraged IBM WatsonX.ai, IBM’s cutting-edge AI platform, to build and deploy the Test-to-SQL model—a natural language processing model that translates user queries into SQL commands. The model enhances the user experience by allowing users to input text-based queries and retrieve structured data efficiently. Here's the step-by-step process that was followed using WatsonX to make the model live:</p>
  <p align="center"><img width="256px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e93fa881-8536-4ea7-9e8b-2196f46f13de"></p>
  <p align="justify">
    <b>1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing with WatsonX Data</b>: Using IBM WatsonX.data, we ingested a large dataset containing human-readable test queries and their corresponding SQL commands. The platform’s ability to handle unstructured data, including various text formats and SQL queries, made the ingestion process seamless. Through WatsonX’s data connectors, we were able to connect various data sources such as relational databases (MySQL) and existing datasets to build a comprehensive training corpus.

      Data Sources: Sample queries and corresponding SQL statements from various domains (e.g., e-commerce, finance).
      Preprocessing: With the help of WatsonX, we cleaned and normalized the text data using built-in text extraction and data cleansing tools, ensuring uniformity in query formats and SQL outputs.

  <b>2. Model Training Using WatsonX.ai</b>: The core of the project revolved around training the Test-to-SQL model using IBM WatsonX.ai. WatsonX provided a flexible and scalable environment to build the machine learning pipeline.

       Model Architecture: We used a Transformer-based architecture for this task, leveraging WatsonX’s Granite model series (Granite-13B-chat) for encoding the natural language queries.

       Transfer Learning: The WatsonX models, trained on large-scale data, offered an excellent base. Using transfer learning, we fine-tuned the pre-existing models using the Test-to-SQL dataset prepared earlier.

       Hyperparameter Optimization: WatsonX’s automated machine learning (AutoML) tools helped optimize hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and the number of epochs, ensuring efficient training and minimizing overfitting.

  <b>3. Real-time Inference via WatsonX.ai APIs</b>: After successfully training the model, we deployed it using WatsonX.ai's APIs for real-time inference. The WatsonX platform provided the necessary tools to deploy the model as a REST API.

       Endpoint Management: The model was exposed through a WatsonX.ai REST endpoint that allowed the translation of natural language queries to SQL commands in real-time.

       API Integration: The API was integrated into the front-end application that users interact with, where they input text queries, and the API returns SQL statements for further execution.


  <b>4. Model Monitoring and Governance with WatsonX Governance</b>:To ensure the continued performance of the Test-to-SQL model and maintain model governance, we employed WatsonX.governance.

       Audit and Monitoring: The model’s performance, including accuracy, response time, and error rates, was continuously monitored using WatsonX’s model management tools. Regular audits ensured the model remained within the set accuracy thresholds.
       Security: WatsonX.governance also helped to implement role-based access controls (RBAC), ensuring that only authorized users could access the sensitive data queried via the model.

  <b>5. Collaboration and Team Management</b>: Throughout the development lifecycle, WatsonX provided a collaborative platform for multiple stakeholders:

       Multi-user environment: Developers and data scientists could simultaneously work on different aspects of the model, such as tweaking the dataset, improving the model, or analyzing the results.
       Versioning and Experiment Tracking: Using WatsonX’s built-in tools for experiment tracking and version control, we could track different versions of the model to ensure consistent improvements and rollback options when needed.

  <b>6. Integrating with Existing Databases</b>: The final step was integrating the Test-to-SQL model with existing relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL to allow live querying. WatsonX’s APIs were instrumental in establishing secure connections to external databases, ensuring that real-time SQL queries could be executed without latency.

       Database Queries: SQL commands generated by the model were dynamically executed on the linked databases to return results, making the entire setup real-time and responsive.

<br>

> <b>Conclusion:</b>
> Using IBM WatsonX, we were able to build, fine-tune, and deploy the Test-to-SQL model seamlessly. WatsonX's advanced AI models, data management tools, and governance features played a pivotal role in ensuring that the model is not only accurate but also scalable and secure for real-world use. This deployment enhances user interaction with databases through natural language queries, simplifying complex SQL command generation.</p>

### Solution architecture <a name="solution-architecture"></a>
<hr>
<p align="center"><img width="1024px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c4595e9-b0cd-4ab0-895e-b500fbf2fd04"></p>

Let's have a look at how things work for a **seller:** <a name="seller"></a>
<p align="justify">1. Once email is entered in the login form, it is checked whether this email is associated with a brand or not? If it is, then an email authentication is carried out (to ensure that the right person is accessing the account) wheeras if the email is new, then some details have to be filled to create a new account. <b>Passwordless authentication</b> is safeguarding the authentication process.</p> 

<p align="justify">2. Brands have two main pages to interact on the website: the <b>products</b> page and the <b>analytics</b> page. The <b>products</b> page allows brands to manage their inventory, while the <b>analytics</b> page offers insights and data related to the brand's performance on the platform. When adding a product, the <b>Zero Shot Image Classification Model</b> automatically generates an appropriate label for the product image to ensure platform-wide consistency. For example, one brand might label a product as a <b>phone</b>, while another might use terms like <b>mobile phone</b> or <b>cell phone</b>. Such inconsistencies could affect the accuracy of the <b>text-to-SQL method</b> that buyers use for queries. The model helps standardize these labels based on existing products in the system. However, if the model encounters an unfamiliar image, such as a jacket, and incorrectly labels it (e.g., as a <b>phone</b>), the brand can manually update the label to ensure proper categorization for future reference. </p>

<p align="justify">3. Whenever a buyer submits a <b>product feedback</b> through the extension, the brand receives it via email. Before sending the feedback, the sentiment/tone is determined using the <b>IBM foundational model, IBM Granite Chat model</b>. In one of the images below, you can see that the tone of the feedback is classified as <b>Appreciative</b> (a simple example, but extremely useful for longer, more complex feedback). Additionally, brands can view a detailed feedback analysis directly on the website through visual graphs.</p>

<p align="justify">Image gallery for the sellers' website:</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

Let's have a look at how things work for a **buyer:** <a name="buyer"></a>

<p align="justify">1. Registration is super-easy and buyers have to provide a couple of details to create their account because that will make up their <b>recommendations</b></p>

<p align="justify">2. Landing section or the first page that one sees is the <b>recomemndations page</b>, where according to the user's gender, age, and interests, the products are shown (increasing the probability of users buying a product)</p>

<p align="justify">3. The <b>feedback section</b> allows the user to send a feedback. There are various type of feedbacks that can be sent. Apart from the brand feedback (that is sent to the brand email), all other feedbacska re sent to my admin id (like General feedback, UI feedback, feature request). For all of the feedbacks, before sending the email, the content of the feedback is sent to the <b>IBM Granite Model</b> so that its tone could be found, and is shared with the email, so that the reader can quickly understanf the feedback.<br><br>Not only this, if a user wants to create a proper feedback, then he/she can <b>wrap the prompt in astericks(*) and then hit enter to get the result back from the IBM foundational model.</b></p>

<p align="justify">4. In order to incentivize the users to continue using the extension, certain badges will be provided which can be seen in the <b>Rewards section</b>. As of now, two badges are there: one for sending first feedback, while the other is for visiting the extension for consecutive 5 days. In either of the cases, users will not only receive the badges, but will also <b>get some cryptocurrency (tfuels)</b></p>

<p align="justify">5. <b>Using the ML Model for Image Classification:</b> WHen you are inside the BRANDS section, then you can provide an image which will be processed by the ML model to fetch the top 3 product labels from the image that are in the product inventory of the application. Let's understand this in a better way:<br><br>
The <b>ML Zero Shot Image Classification model</b> is designed to enhance the buyer's experience by enabling intuitive product discovery. Imagine you like the decor in a friend's room and want to purchase similar items. By simply uploading an image of the room through the extension, the <b>ML model</b> analyzes the image and fetches the top 3 labels that best describe the products present. This intelligent classification ensures you are presented with only the relevant products you're looking for, saving time and effort. This functionality eliminates the need for manual searches and bridges the gap between visual inspiration and online shopping. Additionally, by standardizing product labels across different brands, the model ensures consistency, even when brands use varying terminologies for similar products.
</p>

<p align="justify">6. The <b>text-to-SQL model is made using IBM WatsonX</b> (already discussed in the previous sections). It provides a uique way of interacting with the database and returns the correct response most of the time.</p>

<h3>Now, let's know more about the CHECKOUT process and physical ecovaults</h3>

<p align="justify"><b>🔏 Physical Ecovaults:</b> They are a key innovation in our project, designed to address both sustainability and convenience in the last-mile delivery process. These vaults are strategically deployed physical lockers based on **NodeMCU microcontroller technology**, allowing secure storage for deliveries. With the use of <b>RFID tags</b>, buyers can easily collect their packages at their convenience without relying on traditional delivery windows. This not only reduces the number of redundant delivery trips but also minimizes the carbon footprint associated with e-commerce logistics. By optimizing delivery routes and using eco-friendly vaults, EcoVault Chain ensures that deliveries are both secure and environmentally responsible, paving the way for a greener and more sustainable future in the e-commerce space.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Checkout process:</b> Once the user is happy with the cart, he/she can click on the cart icon, and that will open the checkout webpage which will have the following things:
<ol>
  <li>Previous orders in a tabular format (clicking on it, will open the particular order)</li>
  <li>Vault locations (so that you can see whether you can use the vault feature for pickup or not?)</li>
  <li>Complete the current order by paying for it</li>
  <li>Interact with the <b>WatsonX Orchestrate AI Assistant</b></li>
</ol>
Once you are on the checkout page, click on the <b>Checkout</b> button to see the order in the checkout page and that will check whether you have a <b>physical RFID tag or not?</b> The RFID tag means that you can use the vault feature (as you have the RFID tag). As of now, we have added the tag for only our testing account (because a new user cannot have a physical RFID tag), but do note that, in the future version of the application, the buyer can raise a request for the RFID tag/card, so that they can also avail the vault feature. If the buyer has the physical tag, then the following things will be done:

<ol>
  <li>As of now, there are only 3 vault locations that we have specified in the code (and all of them are in <b>INDIA</b>). At the time of checking out, if you are within <b>10km radius</b> of any of those vaults, you can use the vault feature</li>
  <li>From a maximum of 3 vaults, you can choose which one you would like the order to be dropped at</li>
</ol>

<b>Vault Features:</b> 
<ol>
  <li><b>Secure Storage:</b> Once the order is placed in the vault, it remains securely stored until the buyer retrieves it using their RFID tag. This ensures that the package is safe from theft or damage, making it a reliable option for users.</li>
  <li><b>Eco-Friendly Delivery:</b> By using nearby vaults, the number of delivery trips can be minimized, reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainability.</li>
  <li><b>Real-Time Updates:</b> Buyers receive real-time notifications when their package is placed in the vault and is ready for pickup, adding convenience to the shopping experience.</li>
  <li><b>Flexible Pickup Times:</b> Buyers can retrieve their orders at their convenience from the vault, eliminating the need to wait for a specific delivery window at home or work.</li>
  <li><b>RFID Authentication:</b> Only buyers with an RFID tag can unlock the vault and access their package, ensuring secure access and privacy.</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">As the login process is linked to email, so we cannot provide you demo credentials. So, in case you want to test out the website, you can create a new brand so that you can try out. <b>Note:</b> Once you click on the correct email code, go back to the previous tab from where the authentication flow started, because the UI will change there, not on the page which gets opened after you click on the email content</p>
